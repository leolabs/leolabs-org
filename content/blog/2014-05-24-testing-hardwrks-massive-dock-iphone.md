The iPhone 5 is easily my most used device when I'm not at home. When I'm sitting at my desk, however, the phone usually resides in my pocket because the Apple's old dock isn't compatible with the new Lightning connector. A few days ago, I discovered the [Massive Dock](http://hardwrk.com/en/massive-dock-iphone5.html "Massive Dock") by Hardwrk. This dock is priced at around 60 Euros, is made out of concrete and weighs about 570 grams. Like many other docks, the Lightning connector is not built in, so you have to use an existing Lightning cable or buy one together with it. I don't think that this is a bad thing, because using the Apple's official cable and Lightning connector you can be sure that everything will work as expected. However, if you don't want to use your existing cable, keep in mind that you'll have to pay another 17 to 19 Euros for the cable. When you open the box, you'll find two small sheets of paper, different rubber parts, so your iPhone will fit with different cases and the dock itself.

To set the Massive Dock up, you just place the Lightning cable in the intended slot and slide in one of the two counterpieces depending on whether you use a case or not. After placing the rubber parts in the concrete block and leading the cable through the bottom of the dock, it is ready to be used.

Inserting and removing the phone can be done with one hand as the Massive Dock uses micro suction tape on the bottom to stay on the surface it is placed on. Without a case, the iPhone fits the dock with no problems, however I didn't manage to get it working with the OtterBox Commuter case, maybe it is too thick.

All in all, the Massive Dock looks great. I didn't think that concrete could fit in so well next to the other devices on my desk, like the [MacBook Air](http://leolabs.org/blog/idevices/haswell-macbook-air/ "Testing the 13″ Haswell MacBook Air") or my [Hackintosh](http://leolabs.org/blog/hackintosh-2/ "Building an Ivy Bridge Hackintosh – The Build"). The docks are hand-made meaning that every dock will look a little different, which is also nice. I will recommend this dock to everyone although it is a little pricy. If you have any questions regarding the dock, just leave them in the comments below.
